# Peter Norvig’s “Scrabble” Jupyter Notebook, Binderised and… Azurised?

The original may be found here:

* <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Scrabble.ipynb>

A list of Peter Norvig's Notebooks is here:

**In case it's not obvious:  I did not create this Notebook; Peter Norvig did.**

I originally created this repo so that one may view (and experiment with) this 
wonderful Notebook on [Binder](http://mybinder.org).  Click the badge at the 
top of this README to do so.

I have also created a "library" based on this Notebook on Microsoft's [Azure 
Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com).  Again, click on the relevant badge to 
use this Notebook on Azure.
