# Peter Norvig’s “Scrabble” Jupyter Notebook, Binderised

The original may be found here:

* <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Scrabble.ipynb>

A list of Peter Norvig's Notebooks is here:

* <http://norvig.com/ipython/README.html>

In case it's not obvious:  I did not create this Notebook; Peter Norvig did.

I merely created this repo so that one may view (and experiment with) this 
wonderful Notebook on [Binder](http://mybinder.org).  Click the badge at the 
top of this README to do so…
